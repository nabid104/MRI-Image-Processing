🧠 MRI Image Processing Workflow

This repository follows the BrainSuite BIDS Participant-level Workflow, providing a comprehensive system for processing, analyzing, and visualizing MRI data.
It combines three major pipelines — Anatomical, Diffusion, and Functional — to transform raw MRI scans into meaningful structural, connectivity, and functional information for both research and clinical use.

The Anatomical Pipeline extracts and models brain structures from T1-weighted MRI images.

The Diffusion Pipeline analyzes white matter connectivity using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI).

The Functional Pipeline processes functional MRI (fMRI) data to study neural activity patterns.

Together, these pipelines form an integrated workflow for neuroimaging research, disease diagnosis, and AI-driven analysis.
