# MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) 
This project focuses on MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) image processing and analysis, aiming to extract meaningful insights from medical imaging data. It implements various image enhancement, segmentation, and classification algorithms to improve the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnosis.

MRI technology itself began in the 1970s, pioneered by scientists like Paul Lauterbur and Peter Mansfield, who later received the Nobel Prize in 2003 for their discoveries. The first human MRI scans were performed in 1977, marking the birth of a new era in medical imaging.

The repository includes "Advanced MRI Image Processing Pipeline" — A modular framework for anatomical, diffusion, and functional MRI data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis. Includes noise reduction, normalization, and future integration of deep learning models for automated tumor detection and tissue classification.

Technologies used: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, Brainsuit etc.
